# Corporate-Credit-Ratings-and-Financial-Metrics-Analysis
______________

## 1. Introduction

This project focuses on understanding the relationship between corporate credit ratings and key financial ratios measuring profitability, liquidity, and leverage. By analyzing financial performance across industries and companies, this project aims to identify the financial ratios most correlated with high credit ratings and determine which sectors and corporations outperform in terms of financial health.  

The analysis explores key questions such as:   
• Which financial ratios are most strongly correlated with high credit ratings?  
• Which sectors and corporations demonstrate better financial health relative to their credit rating grade? 

By answering these questions, we can identify financially strong sectors and companies with better creditworthiness and investment potential.  

## 2. Methodology

**Data Source**  
The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kirtandelwadia/corporate-credit-rating-with-financial-ratios), consists of 7805 records, representing financial ratios and credit ratings for 1377 distinct companies. Key financial ratios are covered across three main categories: profitability, liquidity, and leverage.  ***add ratings***  

**Tools and Technologies**  
• SQL: Used for querying and organizing the data.  
• Python: Employed for data analysis and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.  
• PowerBI: Suggested for creating interactive dashboards and visualizing complex insights.  

**Analytical Approach**  
• Data Inspection and Cleaning:  
No missing values were found in the dataset.   
Duplicates: Identified 6428 duplicate records based on the Rating Date, with 1377 distinct companies remaining for analysis.  
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
Financial ratios were analyzed using descriptive statistics to uncover key trends. A focus was placed on profitability, liquidity, and leverage ratios as key indicators of corporate financial health and their influence on credit ratings.  
• Visualization:  
Various visualizations, including bar plots, pie charts, and radar charts, were generated to explore trends and insights in the dataset. A PowerBI dashboard is suggested to provide interactive data exploration.  

## 3. Findings  

***Discuss credit ratings and financial ratios as background for the analysis findings***   

**3.1. Sector Performance and Insights**

The dataset covers companies from various sectors, each contributing differently in terms of financial health and credit ratings. The Business Equipment sector (BusEq), for instance, includes the highest number of top-performing companies, particularly those with strong profitability and liquidity. On the other hand, sectors like Money show fewer companies with strong financial metrics, reflecting their higher volatility and potential risk.  

• Largest sector by company count: Other (176 companies)  
• Smallest sector by company count: Money (29 companies)  

A pie chart reveals that sectors such as Business Equipment, Manufacturing, and Healthcare have the most investment-grade companies, while speculative-grade companies are more evenly distributed across sectors like Retail and Energy.  

**3.2. Credit Rating Distribution**

When analyzing the credit ratings, the majority of companies fall into the BBB category, indicating a relatively average credit risk. AAA rated companies, which represent the strongest credit quality, are rare. The speculative-grade companies are more diverse, with significant numbers falling into lower credit categories like BB and B.  

• Most common rating: BBB (142 companies)  
• Least common rating: D (default) with only 2 companies.  

Insight: The dataset is skewed towards investment-grade ratings, especially BBB, which suggests a conservative risk profile for many companies, although speculative-grade companies with high potential return are also present.  

**3.3. Financial Health of Investment vs. Speculative Grade Companies**

Investment-grade companies (binary rating = 1) consistently show stronger financial health metrics compared to speculative-grade companies (binary rating = 0). These companies exhibit higher profitability margins, stronger liquidity, and lower leverage, indicating lower financial risk.  

• Profitability: Investment-grade companies have higher Operating Margins, EBIT Margins, and Pre-Tax Profit Margins, signaling more efficient operations.  
• Liquidity: These companies also maintain better Current Ratios and Long-Term Debt to Capital ratios, reflecting their ability to cover short- and long-term obligations.  
• Leverage: Lower leverage ratios suggest that investment-grade companies rely less on debt, making them financially more stable in the long term.  

In contrast, speculative-grade companies show weaker profitability and higher volatility in their financial ratios, indicating higher financial risk and vulnerability to market changes.  

**3.4. Best Performing Sectors by Financial Metrics**

Certain sectors, particularly Business Equipment (BusEq), stand out for housing top-performing companies with strong financial performance. Key financial metrics like Operating Margin, EBIT Margin, EBITDA Margin, and Return on Investment (ROI) are consistently higher in these sectors.  

Criteria for top-performing sectors:  
• Operating Margin > 13.33  
• EBIT Margin > 13.44  
• EBITDA Margin > 21.17  
• Pre-Tax Profit Margin > 11.12  
• ROA > 5.87  
• ROI > 9.60  
• Free Cash Flow Per Share > 0.37  
• Long-Term Debt to Capital between 0 and 0.41  

Insight: Companies within Business Equipment consistently meet these performance benchmarks, making the sector a strong candidate for investment focus due to their stable financial health and lower leverage.  

**3.5. Best Performing Companies**

Analyzing the top-performing companies reveals industry leaders like Johnson & Johnson, Google LLC, and Apple Inc., which show strong financial performance across multiple metrics. These companies consistently outperform across key indicators such as Operating Margin, EBIT Margin, EBITDA Margin, and ROI.  

Key financial ratios for top companies:  
• Operating Margin > 13.33  
• EBIT Margin > 13.44  
• Net Profit Margin > 8.07  
• Pre-Tax Profit Margin > 11.12  

These top performers demonstrate strong operational efficiency, profitability, and financial stability. Johnson & Johnson, for example, shows a high Operating Margin and ROA, making it one of the most reliable companies from a financial perspective.  

Visualization Insight: A radar chart can effectively compare these key financial ratios across the top-performing companies, providing a clear visual representation of their financial strengths.

## 4. Investment Strategies

Based on the findings, the following investment strategies are recommended:

• **Focus on Investment-Grade Corporations**:   
Invest in companies with investment-grade ratings as they consistently show strong profitability and financial stability. Examples include Johnson & Johnson, Google LLC, and Apple Inc..  
• **Sector-Specific Investments**:   
Consider focusing on the Business Equipment sector, as it houses the most financially stable and profitable companies. This sector consistently performs well in key ratios, indicating long-term growth potential.  
• **Leverage Profitability Metrics**:   
Use key profitability ratios like EBIT Margin and Net Profit Margin to identify companies that are likely to deliver strong returns.  
• **Diversify Across Sectors**:   
To mitigate risk, diversify investments across sectors with high-performing companies, such as Healthcare, Utilities, and Technology, all of which show strong financial health and growth potential.  

## 5. Conclusion
